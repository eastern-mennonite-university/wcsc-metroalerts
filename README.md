A overlay for the WMATA Rail map that shows where there are incidents and maintenance happening.

To get started, go look at [Google's Python Quickstart Guide](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python "Google Gmail API Quickstart") and [ThePythonCode's amazing guide](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/use-gmail-api-in-python "PythonCode's Gmail API Guide") on doing all of the basics with the API.

Dependencies and software: 

- I am using Python 3.10.6 to make this project.

- The only dependencies you need to download are Google's PIP packages, which is in a helpful command in the quickstart. The rest of the libraries are built in. 

- In order to get your API project setup, look at ThePythonCode's guide.
### Note:
You will need to make a full fledged API project with Google in order to use OAuth, if you haven't already made a project.
